## Project Description
This project demonstrates several fundamental grayscale image processing operations implemented on an embedded system (STM32F446RET6). The raw grayscale image is stored in memory, processed on the microcontroller.

The following questions are implemented in STM32 CUBE IDE:

- Q1-a) Form a C function on the microcontroller to calculate histogram of a given grayscale image. 
- Q1-b) Form a grayscale image of your choice with appropriate size on PC. Store it as a header file.Then, add this header file to your new project. Calculate its histogram. Show histogram entries (at least some of them) on STM32Cube IDE.
- Q2-a) Derive the histogram equalization method by pencil and paper. Post your result here by taking the photo of your derivation on the paper.
- Q2-b) Form a C function on the microcontroller to apply histogram equalization on a given grayscale image.
- Q2-c) Use the grayscale image formed in the previous question. Apply histogram equalization to it. Calculate its histogram. Show histogram entries (at least some of them) on STM32Cube IDE.
- Q3-a) Form a C function on the microcontroller to apply 2D convolution on a given grayscale image. 
- Q3-b) Use the grayscale image formed in the previous question. Apply low pass filtering to it. Show f iltered image entries (at least some of them) on STM32Cube IDE. 
- Q3-c) Use the grayscale image formed in the previous question. Apply high pass filtering to it. Show f iltered image entries (at least some of them) on STM32Cube IDE. 
- Q4-a) Form a C function on the microcontroller to apply median filtering on a given grayscale image. 
- Q4-b) Use the grayscale image formed in the previous question. Apply median filtering to it. Show f iltered image entries (at least some of them) on STM32Cube IDE.
